<i>Once there was a band,</i>

20
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:40,622
<i>three people brought
together by music.</i>

21
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,192
<i>I brought my axe,</i>

22
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,463
<i>Rachel brought her golden voice,</i>

23
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,268
<i>and Scott brought the tunes.</i>

24
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:58,603
<i>And there was sex, and drugs,
and murder, and mayhem,</i>

25
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,609
<i>and a bunch of other shit
you won't believe.</i>

26
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:03,408
<i>I wouldn't.</i>

27
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:08,416
<i>It all started
one dark and stormy night.</i>

28
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,420
<i>I was celebrating my 50th
birthday for the third time.</i>

29
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,622
<i>Who the hell are you people?</i>

30
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,758
<i>And what the hell
are you listening to?</i>

31
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>I let my daughter
Chloe sponsor the party</i>

32
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,894
<i>with some vodka company,</i>

33
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,532
<i>just to make a few bucks.</i>

34
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,531
<i>She was a hustler,</i>

35
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,669
<i>a real ball-buster
like her old man.</i>

36
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,973
<i>So of course,
she put on the one song I hate.</i>

37
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,708
<i>You heard this one, haven't you?</i>

38
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,978
<i>Every few years it ends up
in a beer commercial,</i>

39
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,746
<i>number one on the charts,</i>

40
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,884
<i>my one hit, my meal ticket.</i>

41
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,718
<i>I peaked at 20,
and I've been circling</i>

42
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,724
<i>the bowl of this
business ever since.</i>

43
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,300
Yeah, yeah, I'll be happy

44
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,536
if I never had to hear
that fucking song again.

45
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:05,537
Oh, but it's your birthday,
Pops.

46
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,340
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,482
Are you sure this
is the right house?

48
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:17,950
Dude, I don't know.
All these houses

49
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,622
in the hills look the same,
so let's just assume it is.

50
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,690
- Pardon me.
- Oh!

51
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,620
Dude!

52
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,727
- What's up?
- This fucking house is sick.

53
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:29,630
Look at that shit.

54
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:31,931
Are you shootin'?

55
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,566
Wanna leave your
guitar in the car, man?

56
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,767
Fuck, you know what?

57
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,967
You start playing
Kumbaya for the chicks.

58
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,535
Go fuck yourself, okay?

59
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:38,907
Stop.

60
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,806
Party over here!

61
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:49,583
Thank you, sweetie.

62
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,922
<i>Did fate bring them to me
or was it random?</i>

63
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,722
- <i>Who knows?</i>
- What's that?

64
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,558
Turn, turn, turn.
Fuckin' Dirt Pipe,

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,859
- remember them?
- Holy shit!

66
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:02,727
- Yeah, by Jimmy Kleen.
- Jimmy Kleen, yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,496
He had that hit in the '80s?

68
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:06,680
- Come on.
- <i>I tell you this much,</i>

69
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,102
<i>opportunity walked
right up to me,</i>

70
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>and I almost punched
his lights out.</i>

71
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,106
<i>Story of my life.</i>

72
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,443
Check out those guitars,
dude, that's sick.

73
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,678
Hey, no cameras!

74
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:22,918
Who the fuck are you guys?

75
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,521
You brought your own guitar?

76
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,391
Come here.

77
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
Come over here.

78
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,595
You here to play me your demo?

79
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:37,698
No.

80
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:40,501
Then why the fuck are you
at my house, at my party?

81
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:43,938
I followed a girl here.

82
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,478
That's how I got here, too.

83
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,580
Here, come on, take a seat.

84
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:02,457
You like that, huh?

85
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,828
The Rickenbacker 12-string.

86
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:12,666
It's the hollow body.

87
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:16,100
Harrison had one.

88
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,705
Man knows his scripture.

89
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:43,970
Can I play it?

90
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:44,933
Can I fuck your sister?

91
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,500
Play yours.

92
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:55,710
Come on, destiny awaits.

93
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,390
Who is that?

94
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,776
I was going to ask you.

95
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,743
I have no idea.

96
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,113
Friend of yours?

97
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:33,815
That's the girl.

98
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,889
You're not going over there,
are you?

99
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,787
It's beautiful.

100
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,220
Hey, where are you going?

101
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,622
I... I can't.

102
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:50,959
Come on, you just did.

103
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,327
I'm Jimmy.

104
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:54,261
What's your name?

105
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,128
I'm Rachel.

106
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,297
Hey, come here.

107
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,601
This is...

108
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,870
I'm Scott.

109
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,802
You sounded great.

110
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:05,906
You, too.

111
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:07,750
Thanks.

112
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:08,776
Let her have a seat,

113
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,811
- caveman.
- Sorry, sorry.

114
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,782
Hey,
let me ask you something.

115
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:18,285
You guys ever been in a band?

116
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,696
<i>I had to get us playing fast,</i>

117
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,266
<i>to see if she had the goods.</i>

118
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,901
<i>I could tell she was skittish,
but she liked Scott,</i>

119
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:38,373
<i>so I figured I could
control her through him.</i>

120
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,756
Male, female, yeah?

121
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,166
Excuse me.

122
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,103
Come over here.
Excuse me.

123
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:10,704
Stand here.

124
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:12,303
No, I don't... I don't wanna be
the center of attention,

125
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,174
I just...

126
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,275
want to be in the band.

127
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,311
You're over here.

128
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:19,681
You're over here.

129
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:21,650
So what's a band?

130
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,385
It's a statement, an ethos,

131
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:26,387
where everything
means something.

132
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,923
Nirvana just didn't happen
to dress like roadies.

133
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,855
That was a decision.

134
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,294
The Beatles bowed after
every song, that was a choice.

135
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,698
You know, it's all calculated.
It's all created.

136
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:38,997
It's all about the concept.

137
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,970
And our concept
centers around you.

138
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,939
You're in charge,
you're the front man.

139
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:48,720
No, no, no, no, no.

140
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,443
I'm the band leader.

141
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,210
The front man
stands in the front,

142
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,747
you engage the audience.

143
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,183
I'm the band leader.

144
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,184
I'm with the band,

145
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,883
keep the train on schedule.

146
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,886
Our concept was
never just her.

147
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:02,186
- Yeah.
- It's us.

148
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,857
We are a band, we are one.

149
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,327
But it's not Hollow Bodies,
it's Hollow Body.

150
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,861
Trust me.

151
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,327
You're the star.

152
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,650
We want every girl
to want to be her

153
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,998
and all the guys
want to fuck her.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,300
We want every girl
to want to fuck you.

155
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:17,772
All right, fine.

156
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,440
Well, band leader....

157
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,178
- Yeah.
- What do you want to start with?

158
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:26,147
Let's start with "Perfect Day,"
seems fitting.

159
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,150
All right.

160
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:30,452
One, two...

161
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:31,419
That's my part.

162
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,187
One, two, three, four.

163
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:45,933
<i>Scott was easy to figure out.</i>

164
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,102
<i>I was him, once.</i>

165
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,874
<i>Trying to balance
the work with the wife.</i>

166
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,776
<i>Something's gotta give.</i>

167
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:58,813
<i>What's her name, this girl?</i>

168
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,183
Rachel.

169
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,753
How old is she?

170
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,484
I don't know.

171
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:07,920
What, you were there all night

172
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,324
and you don't know
how old she is?

173
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:13,240
What am I, on trial now, Carrie?
I mean...

174
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,300
Okay, um...

175
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:22,403
It's just... It's just strange.

176
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,305
You trust me.

177
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:27,207
I trust you.

178
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,244
I would never...

179
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,480
never do anything
to mess this up.

180

181

<i>And then there was

188

Shouldn't you not be
drinking with your medicine?

194
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,700
Don't you worry about me.

195
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,843
I'm going to outlive all of you.

196
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,979
How old did he say he was?

197
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:41,248
Who?

198
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:42,983
That Scott.

199
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:47,418
I don't know.

200
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,589
Well, is he 40?

201
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,592
He's 33.

202
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,392
Isn't that old to be still
doing this, don't you think?

203
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:54,960
Jimmy's 50-something.

204
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,865
Well, he's a name.

205
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,532
He has connections.

206
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,401
What has Scott got?

207
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:02,936
Talent.

208
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,975
What do you know about him?

209
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,646
He's married.
He's got a baby.

210
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,617
A husband and a father.

211
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,285
How's he supporting his
family while he's doing this?

212
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:19,887
Why do you care?

213
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,193
Sweetheart, I'm just
making sure you're protected.

214
00:14:32,980 --> 00:29:05,947
It's special.

215
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,390
These entertainment people,
you know what they can be like.

216
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,118
<i>I had my own problems.</i>

217
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,320
<i>I'm underwater
in this stupid house</i>

218
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:58,456
<i>and I have to go beg
from Richie Rolands.</i>

219
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,258
<i>Richie runs
a multinational media empire</i>

220
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,295
<i>that he inherited from his dad,</i>

221
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,466
<i>who I once made
a ton of cash for.</i>

222
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,436
<i>Now I got to go kiss
Junior's ring.</i>

223
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,404
So who's fucking her?

224
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,636
You?

225
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:12,573
This guy?

226
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,443
Is she a tomcat in the sack?
What's the deal? Talk to me.

227
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:18,246
A tomcat's a male cat.

228
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,149
Just listen to the track.

229
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:24,115
Just send me the link.
You want me to listen to it

230
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,551
on your bullshit phone speakers?
Come on, man.

231
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:29,222
- Well, come up to the studio.
- I got to go in a minute.

232
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,324
Listen, I'm not her dad.

233
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,526
If she wants to fuck you,
she can fuck you.

234
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,327
That's why you're not
fucking her, right?

235
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:38,650
Because you're like
her dad or something?

236
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,369
Hell, man, you look like shit.

237
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:45,106
How are you living like this?

238
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,474
I mean, what's going on?

239
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:50,678
Yeah, I don't know.

240
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,790
I'm getting fat
and my house is falling apart.

241
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,119
Everything just went to shit
after this bitch left me.

242
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,180
How did Chloe take it?

243
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,910
Oh, that's not Chloe's mom,
that was the one before.

244
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,759
You know,
but Chloe threw a party,

245
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,625
she burned her furs in effigy.

246
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,629
Chip off the old block, huh?

247
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:13,534
Well, I'll give you this,
she's got a look.

248
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,103
- She's got it all.
- So what?

249
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,737
I mean, how many YouTube subs
does she have?

250
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,338
What kind of metrics
are we talking about?

251
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,307
Come on, man, that's the way
things are going these days,

252
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,343
- you got to keep up.
- Now, don't give me that.

253
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:28,113
She is gold and I can spot gold.

254
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,350
Come on, Richie.

255
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:31,219
You know...

256
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:35,387
the last time you called me
Richie, I was an unpaid intern

257
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:37,455
and you were too fucking high
to remember my name.

258
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:40,193
So try and remember now,
now it's Rick.

259
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:43,295
Sorry, Rick.

260
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,133
You're just not that memorable.

261
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,565
She is.

262
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,802
Well, see, the thing is,

263
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,500
and you don't seem
to be getting this,

264
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:52,237
is I don't really do
A & R anymore, okay?

265
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,372
I'm launching a music
streaming platform,

266
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:56,411
I'm not trying to
sign your little band.

267
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:58,676
And just a bit of advice:

268
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,378
you should move on.

269
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,148
You're fucking 50, all right?

270
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,715
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

271
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:07,870
You can't be out there
shaking your ass.

272
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:11,225
That's why I need this to work.

273
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:15,459
Why'd you even
come over anyway, then?

274
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,463
I came over here out of
respect to our friendship,

275
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,699
because we go way back.

276
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,267
And my physical therapist
is right around the corner,

277
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:24,671
he's actually Geffen's guy.

278
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:32,813
All right, look.

279
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,212
I know a guy,

280
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,180
he's always looking
for opening acts.

281
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,749
Maybe I can get you
a West Coast tour

282
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,583
or something,
how does that sound?

283
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,588
- Yeah, we can do that.
- No frills.

284
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,754
I don't care about
accommodations.

285
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:45,557
All I care about are advances.

286
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,725
Fifty grand or something.

287
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,831
Oh, an advance?
You want an advance?

288
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,530
What is this, 1989?

289
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:53,665
Get 500,000 Instagram followers

290
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,833
and then talk to me
about an advance.

291
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:57,404
Ten grand, anything?

292
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,440
I love you, man.

293
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,276
I really do,
I get a kick out of ya.

294
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,546
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
text you the guy's info.

295
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:09,150
And I'm going to send
my maids over.

296
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,621
Thanks, Richie.

297
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:15,523
Rick.

298
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,395
It's time to start playing out.

299
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:24,332
You hear me?

300
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:26,400
- Already?
- Yeah.

301
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,704
Don't you think it's too soon?

302
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,675
I mean, yeah,
are you sure we're ready?

303
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:37,242
It's the only way
to spread the word.

304
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:39,476
It's the only way
to really get good.

305
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:40,515
All right.

306
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:42,246
Yeah, when we play out,
there's no safety net.

307
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,918
We don't have guitar techs,

308
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,684
so you have to tune,
change your strings,

309
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,820
hook up the PA, you got to
be good, you got to be fast.

310
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:49,890
All right?

311
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,491
And you have to
command the stage.

312
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,194
They're there to see
a performance.

313
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,231
Something they'll remember.

All right, let's do it again.

320
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:57,959
- Uh, can I help you?
- Oh, uh, the door was open.

321
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,327
- I'm here for Rachel.
- Oh, you must be her mom.

322

I'm Jimmy.

324
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:04,966
Well, you're in
pretty good shape

325
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:07,264
for an older guy.

326
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:08,736
Older than what?

327
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,772
I'm probably the oldest woman
that's ever been in this house.

328
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:13,838
I wouldn't say that exactly.

329
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,376
You raised
quite a talented daughter.

330
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:20,514
Yes, I did.

331
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,190
You look kind of
beat up in this one.

332
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,686
That was a long time ago.

333
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:30,554
And yet, there it is
on the wall like you miss it.

334
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,459
More of a cautionary tale.

335
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:37,361
We all carry the seeds of
our own destruction, Mr. Klein.

336
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:38,565
You're telling me.

337
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,270
Mom?

338
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,636
What are you doing here?

339
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:46,506
Oh, honey,
I thought we could have lunch.

340
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,572
Hi, I'm Scott.

341
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:49,976
You're the writer.

342
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,980
I can see why she likes you.

343
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,780
Well, I mean,

344
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:57,518
actually we kind of
all write the songs.

345
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,486
Some of them are quite good.

346
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:00,788
Thanks.

347
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:02,923
But where is this all going?

348
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:05,580
Well, I wasn't
going to mention this

349
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,660
but since you're here,

350
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,290
there is label interest

351
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,998
and a few touring dates.

352
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,731
A tour?

353
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:13,701
Just West Coast dates.

354
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,567
So, is this part
of a record deal?

355
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:18,336
No, there's nothing concrete,
there's no advance.

356
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:20,638
It's just for some exposure.

357
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,444
- Twelve dates, fourteen days.
- Hm.

358
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:26,380
Look, I'm just not
sure about all this.

359
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,982
Come on, haven't you ever
road-tripped before?

360
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,517
Every summer.

361
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,530
Perfect.

362
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,323
We have to talk about this,
Rachel.

363
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:38,926
Let's go,
say goodbye to your friends.

364
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,728
<i>Ah, Barb,
playing hard to get.</i>

365
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,336
<i>We hit the road
two weeks after that,</i>

366
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,103
<i>one last run.</i>

367
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:52,807
<i>Getting out there again,</i>

368
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:54,408
<i>I got excited.</i>

369
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:56,744
<i>I thought maybe
my luck had changed.</i>

370
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:58,345
<i>It did.</i>

371
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,470
<i>It got worse.</i>

372
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,957
How are you doing?

373
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:14,495
All right, listen,
this is the perfect crowd.

374
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,927
They're just drunk enough.

375
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,131
Good training wheels.

376
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,502
Just seems
like a lot of people.

377
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,439
I once played to 40,000
people on three hits of acid.

378
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,840
No, you didn't.

379
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:30,878
Yeah, that's what they told me.

380
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,911
I don't remember shit
but if I can do that,

381
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:34,914
you can do this.

382
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,486
Look at that guy,
do you even care what he thinks?

383
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:43,491
It's just like rehearsal,
all right?

384
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:45,158
Okay.

385
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,690
Do you trust me?

386
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:47,692
No.

387
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,600
Well, good.

388
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,640
That's 'cause you're smart.

389
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,965
Look, here, it's going to get
hot under the lights.

390
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,100
You're going to have
to take this off.

391
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,938
Jimmy.

392
00:22:58,638 --> 00:22:59,874
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

393
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,176
You look beautiful.

394
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:03,143
Thanks.

395
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,578
See, I told you.

396
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:05,678
Okay.

397
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:07,611
You're on.

398
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:08,915
All right, let's go, guys.

399
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:25,765
Hey, we're Hollow Body.

400
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:27,567
And we're from Los Angeles.

401
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:34,380
"Perfect Day."

402
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,700
One, two, three, four.

403
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,649
Are you okay?

404
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:56,530
Do you guys think
I like the road?

405
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,754
Carrying my own gear?

406
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,726
Bad food and truck stop shits?

407
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,260
No, but that's the road.

408
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:04,598
You do your fucking job
and you get on with it.

409
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,567
Dude, she had a bad night.

410
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:09,634
Yeah, well you better get
your shit together, honey,

411
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,305
'cause Mommy's not here
to fucking help you anymore.

412
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:13,271
She gets it,
just give her time.

413
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,740
Oh, time?
Let me tell you about time.

414
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,908
You're 33 years old
with a wife and a kid.

415
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,279
She's 23 years old.

416
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:22,249
She's got five or six more
fuck-ups in her life.

417
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,118
You have no Plan B.

418
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,620
And this is Plan A.

419
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,257
Fucking bullshit.

420
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,240
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- No, hey, hey,

421
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,630
don't listen to that
fucking dickhead.

422
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:37,564
Bullshit.

423
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,296
Put that fucking camera down

424
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,670
or I'll stick it up
your fucking ass.

425
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,271
Think he's fucking Scorsese.

426
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,245
Goddamn it!

427
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:57,510
Shit!

428
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:03,855
What the hell's the problem now?

429
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:05,857
It's the battery.
Neil said it was touchy.

430
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:06,894
It's not fucking working.

431
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,127
Nice.

432
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:11,298
This was a fucking
embarrassment in there.

433
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,630
I had to pull
favors for that gig.

434
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,350
- It makes me look bad.
- Next time, she'll be ready.

435
00:26:16,602 --> 00:26:17,438
Next time?

436
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,372
There isn't gonna be
a next time.

437
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:22,241
If she can't tour,
it's fucking done.

438
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,876
I'll sing lead
for a couple of shows.

439
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,209
It's not a big deal!

440
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,115
You think the frat boys
came out to see you?

441
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,787
Listen,
you're just along for the ride.

442
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,530
You're a decent songwriter,

443
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,755
an okay singer,
and quite frankly,

444
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,157
- a shitty guitarist.
- You know what?

445
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,658
- You know what I'm good at?
- What?

446
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,360
Getting her
to put up with your bullshit.

447
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:44,795
You're just a fucking has-been

448
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:46,798
who hasn't written
a goddamn good song

449
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,369
in 20 fucking years.

450
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:49,801
Well, bite me!

451
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:51,369
Finally we get
some focus back!

452
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:53,705
Fuck you,
you fucking piece of shit!

453
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:54,408
Fuck you.

454
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:58,712
I like seeing you
get mad, finally.

455
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:00,279
Fuck off, Zach!

456
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:07,854
Your mommy's here.

457
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:10,990
Okay, this?

458
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,292
All this...

459
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:13,794
is over.

460
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,300
This is all too much for her.

461
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,766
So sweetheart,
let's just go home.

462
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,269
Get in the car.

463
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:26,500
Now.

464
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,318
Rachel.

465
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:43,924
Are you all right?

466
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:10,751
Jesus fuck!

467
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:19,590
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel!

468
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,843
<i>I understand second chances.</i>

469
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,176
<i>I've almost died a few times.</i>

470
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:16,460
<i>Overdose here, overdose there,</i>

471
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,450
<i>stabbed in prison even.</i>

472
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,319
<i>There's no white light.</i>

473
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,422
<i>But Rachel's not like me.</i>

474
00:29:24,157 --> 00:29:25,425
<i>She's fragile.</i>

475
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,463
<i>This could have broke her.</i>

476
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:50,214
<i>Or maybe Barb dying
would finally set Rachel free.</i>

477
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:59,259
<i>Man, was I wrong about that.</i>

478
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:04,297
<i>So you think after that
she'd take it easy.</i>

479
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:06,199
<i>Wrong.</i>

480
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,300
<i>She went crazy.</i>

481
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:16,176
<i>And of course Chloe was there
to enable all her bad behavior.</i>

482
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,111
- Here.
- <i>I get it.</i>

483
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,948
<i>Cheat death,
you don't cash out,</i>

484
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,249
<i>you double down.</i>

485
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:31,892
Wow.

486
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,158
You never did that before.

487
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,930
There's a lot of things
I've never done before, huh?

488
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,968
Yes,
another proof of concept, yes.

489
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,405
I'm going to try every
single one of them.

490
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:51,911
Good, you ready to go on?

491
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:55,115
No, that part still scares me.

492
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:57,130
You've got this.

493
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,182
You just need to, like,

494
00:30:58,184 --> 00:30:59,987
loosen up a little bit,

495
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,221
and don't get too drunk.

496
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:05,992
I kind of like getting drunk.

497
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:10,530
Do you wanna...

498
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:13,660
try something?

499
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,272
Like what?

500
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,212
Like him?

501
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,449
You want me to...

502
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:32,686
Yes.

503
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:36,387
Go, kiss a stranger.
Just make out with somebody.

504
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:37,556
Work off some of this...

505
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,525
nervous energy.

506
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,964
I've got to go.
Hey, don't take too long.

507
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,167
You're on soon.

508
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,169
- Yeah.
- If you don't, I will.

509
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:57,177
Oh, my God.

510
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,527
Hi.

511
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,294
Hi.

512
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,736
Sorry, um...

513
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,543
Oh.

514
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,112
Hey, you okay?

515
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,500
You okay?

516
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:40,619
You all right?

517
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,369
Dude, this thing is amazing.

518
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,205
Yeah, just don't mess it up.

519
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,572
Stacey's not allowed
at this event.

520
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:03,640
I'll be gentle.

521
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,111
I don't like her,
make her leave.

522
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,645
Thanks for setting this up,
baby.

523
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:09,649
Oh, please,
I'm doing this for Rachel.

524
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,118
Not you, old man.

525
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:13,716
This is what you have
to look forward to

526
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,860
when you get older.

527
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,757
No, he looks like
he's probably a good dad.

528
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,459
As long as he doesn't
keep hanging out with you.

529
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:22,729
That's my girl.

530
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:17,350
Rachel, we're on.

531
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,595
Coming.

532
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

533
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,801
next up, we have...

534
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:40,206
Hollow Body.

535
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:45,644
Hey, we're Hollow Body.

536
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,381
Don't kill animals...

537
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:50,780
unless they have
it coming to them.

538
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,182
Porky!

539
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:54,854
And the star of our show,
Ms. Rachel Swann!

540
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:01,394
What's this?

541
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,863
Thought we could
try something new.

542
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:05,799
Okay.

543
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:07,501
All right, fellas.

544
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,402
How's everybody feeling
out there?

545
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:12,505
All right, she wants to try
something new here.

546
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:14,437
Something new?
Are you fucking kidding me?

547
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:17,276
Yeah, don't worry,
it's easy, it's in A.

548
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,311
Just put your big boy pants on.
This is rock and roll.

549
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,579
Let's go, guys.

550
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:22,546
Ready?

551
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:23,816

Yeah.

589
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,240
Since when do you smoke?

590
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,724
Since when do
you care what I do?

591
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:29,595
Hey.

592
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,610
You about ready?

593
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,829
Yeah,
she's fine, she's just drunk.

594
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:33,732
Whoa.

595
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

596
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,934
Whoa, whoa.

597
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:39,470
Back up, back up,
give her some air.

598
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:41,400
Hey, you all right?
You okay?

599
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,710
Did you take something?

600
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,842
I don't know.
How did I do that?

601
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,809
Come on, all right.

602
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:47,845
How did I do that?

603
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,178
Come on,
come on, come on.

604
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,617
All right,
nothing to see here. Come on.

605
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:52,582
Let's go.

606
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:54,520
Dude,
turn that fucking thing off!

607
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,787
<i>Now that I
knew she could deliver,</i>

608
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,955
<i>I had to get Rick on board.</i>

609
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:01,590
<i>He'd been avoiding me
after our last fuck up,</i>

610
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:03,729
<i>but I knew the bartender
at his favorite restaurant.</i>

611
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:09,320
- Ricky!
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

612
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,903
You don't write,
you don't call?

613
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,769
We got nothing
to talk about, okay?

614
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:15,738
I gave you a shot, right?

615
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,750
- You blew it.
- No, look at this, look at this.

616
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,542
Struck by lightning.

617
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:20,776
Dead for three hours.

618
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:22,479
Her mom killed
right next to her.

619
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,715
It's a rock and roll tragedy.
I saw the whole thing.

620
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:25,849
She died?

621
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:28,488
Yeah, and then she
came back to life

622
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,860
for our sins.

623
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,187
That's quite a lot for you.

624
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:33,900
Congratulations.

625
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,791
For me?
This guy,

626
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,126
- we had some times.
- Oh, yeah?

627
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:39,620
- Crazy times, yeah.
- All right, let me talk to you.

628
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,731
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Tracey.

629
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:43,169
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
Jimmy, nice to meet you.

630
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:44,968
- Have we met before?
- No.

631
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,105
- No?
- What do you need?

632
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:47,803
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Vegas or something?

633
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,840
No, why are you
doing this to me?

634
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:52,845
Just give it a listen, please.

635
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,144
Why?

636
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:55,745
Come on,
we got a bunch of new songs.

637
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,747
There's a clip
from her performance.

638
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:58,782
Why?

639
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,182
She's possessed, it's crazy.

640
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:01,517
I'm telling you.

641
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,521
You want me to get on
my knees or something?

642
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:06,990
Yeah, I do.

643
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:09,863
I've been on my knees
since I got into this business.

644
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,663
Come on, just give it a listen.

645
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:13,933
All right.

646
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:15,901
I'll do that.

647
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:17,904
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

648
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:19,769
Take it easy, man.

649
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,704
Stop doing this, okay?
You're all frantic.

650
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:22,905
- All right.
- You seem crazy.

651
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:23,809
Thanks, Rick.

652
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:25,177
Tracey, pleasure.

653
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:26,545
Whoa.

654
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,291
Okay.

655
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,232
<i>Hey, what you doing?</i>

656
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:48,000
Daddy duty.

657
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:51,167
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

658
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:55,575
<i>Oh, I remember when
Chloe was that young,</i>

659
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
<i>that little soft
spot on her head.</i>

660
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,280
You ever think you'd
have a 20-year-old?

661
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:02,314
<i>I never thought
I'd live to be 20.</i>

662
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:06,785
<i>So, I know you're all cozy
there and everything, but...</i>

663
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:09,186
<i>we need you over here.</i>

664
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:10,289
Right now?

665
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:12,550
<i>Yeah, uh, Rachel's coming over.</i>

666
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,591
<i>I need to redo the guitar parts,</i>

667
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:15,691
<i>we need harmonies.</i>

668
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,930
<i>So, get your ass over here.</i>

669
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,832
Jimmy, dude, it's late.

670
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,166
<i>Yeah, you know what, I get it.</i>

671
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,667
<i>It's cool.</i>

672
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,870
<i>I'll just call my buddy,
Owen, up.</i>

673
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:28,204
<i>He's an amazing guitar player.</i>

674
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,609
<i>He could probably sing
some harmonies, too.</i>

675
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:36,460
Okay, all right.

676
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,713
<i>That's my boy.</i>

677
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:38,750
<i>See you soon.</i>

678
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:42,322
Take her?

679
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

680
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,950
It's all right.

681
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,303
Baby, you seen my keys?

682
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:02,740
Uh, yeah, here.

683
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:04,343
Where are you going?

684
00:43:05,744 --> 00:43:06,646
Jimmy's.

685
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:08,880
You didn't say this...

686
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:11,500
was an every-night thing.

687
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,684
It's not.

688
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,687
I miss you.

689
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,550
After a long day
of taking care of her,

690
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,959
I need someone
to take care of me, too.

691
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:27,699
I miss us.

692
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:32,350
I mean, you're either sleeping

693
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,390
or you're with her.

694
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:36,800
She'll sleep through
the night soon.

695
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:39,277
Carrie...

696
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,316
We haven't had sex in months.

697
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:48,221
Is that why you stay
over there until 4:00 a.m.?

698
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:52,659
No.

699
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:55,395
Jimmy likes to work late.

700
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,950
Jimmy, and...?

701
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,865
Rachel.

702
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:01,698
And you're with her

703
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,166
and some pervy old guy.

704
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:04,133
Pervy?

705
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:05,102
Carrie, come on.

706
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:06,336
I looked him up.

707
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:09,409
Okay, so he's someone
you can look up.

708
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,976
Maybe that's all
you need to know.

709
00:44:11,677 --> 00:44:12,378
Okay.

710
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:18,840
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:19,952
Look, it's just...

712
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:26,425
This is a once
in a lifetime thing for me.

713
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:31,329
This...

714
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,332
this right here...

715
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:37,936
is a once in a lifetime thing.

716
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:02,240
<i>...is about to pound this area</i>

717
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,926
<i>with some gusty winds,
torrential rain,</i>

718
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,296
<i>and a lot of lightning,
unfortunately.</i>

719
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:07,930
<i>And of course,
people who are outside...</i>

720
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:17,876
<i>I could've stopped it,
but I didn't.</i>

721
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:19,779
<i>She made him better.</i>

722
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:23,480
<i>When she changed,
we all changed.</i>

723
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,421
<i>She was a force of nature.</i>

724
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,923
<i>Hell, she even
started booking gigs.</i>

725
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,958
<i>She got us a wedding</i>

726
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:10,260
<i>that paid ten grand
for one night.</i>

727
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,197
<i>I'm not too proud.</i>

728
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:38,957
<i>What's gotten into her?</i>

729
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:41,593
Girl's got the devil in her.

730
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:43,296
And a liter of vodka.

731
00:46:44,229 --> 00:46:46,232
It's like she's
a completely different person.

732
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:48,970
She'll say something,

733
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,166
and then you'll remind
her about it the next day

734
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:51,503
and then she won't
even remember it.

735
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,336
I know what
you're talking about.

736
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:54,240
I've seen that.

737
00:46:54,972 --> 00:46:56,108
She blacks out.

738
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,541
Listen, she's an artist.

739
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:00,460
She hears voices.

740
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:01,313
You're a songwriter.

741
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:02,914
You know what that's like.

742
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:08,919
That lightning did something
to her, I'm telling you.

743
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:11,157
Can't have rock and roll
without electricity.

744
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,356
We're all electricity
when you think about it.

745
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:17,529
Every thought we have,
synapsis...

746
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,133
She needs help.

747
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,137
Listen, those voices in her head

748
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:27,105
are our ticket to ride.

749
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:32,945
Bitch better have my money!

750
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,950
Rachel, you all right?

751
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:42,151
Jesus Christ.

752
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,640
Here you go, daddy.

753
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:55,966
Cash money.

754
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:58,100
Yeah, I think the bride's dad

755
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,439
was in the Armenian mafia
or something.

756
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:04,443
We haven't even talked
about the fact that, um...

757
00:48:06,278 --> 00:48:08,311
a guy died
in the parking lot tonight.

758
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:10,115
I don't remember any of that.

759
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:13,952
You don't remember
an ambulance and a dead guy?

760
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,157
He was, like, they said
27, heart attack, right?

761
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,691
Did you say heart attack?

762
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:21,559
<i>Heart attack?</i>

763
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,428
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

764
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:26,665
<i>Later we found out the LAPD
didn't know what to call it.</i>

765
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:30,680
<i>They had no idea what
they were dealing with.</i>

766
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:31,568
<i>Neither did we.</i>

767
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,669
Well, I heard at
the Animal Benefit

768
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:36,441
that this guy, well,
he also died of a heart attack.

769
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:38,711
She's breaking hearts already.

770
00:48:42,514 --> 00:48:44,500
I'm tired.

771
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:46,519
Yeah.

772
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,688
You should be,
that was a hell of a show.

773
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:52,258
You just need
to calm down a little.

774
00:48:52,957 --> 00:48:54,693
No, I need to speed up

775
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:57,595
and catch up on all
the stuff that I missed out on.

776
00:48:58,363 --> 00:48:59,665
No, you need to relax.

777
00:49:01,298 --> 00:49:02,200
Okay.

778
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:04,669
Help me.

779
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:14,747
I can't.

780
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:21,530
I need you to.

781
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:38,137
Jesus.

782
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:42,574
Rachel...

783
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,477
What, are you my mother?

784
00:49:46,477 --> 00:49:48,244
Between your judging

785
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:50,245
and your pushing me
all the time,

786
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:51,416
it's like she never left.

787
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
Don't you think
you've had enough?

788
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:56,486
Fuck you, Jimmy.

789
00:49:56,488 --> 00:49:58,620
I mean, who are you
to be lecturing anybody

790
00:49:58,622 --> 00:49:59,791
about anything?

791
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,349
I mean, after all, Jimmy,

792
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:27,653
you're just a one-hit wonder,

793
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:32,570
a two-time felon,

794
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:35,561
three-time divorcée,

795
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:39,564
no talent ex-junkie.

796
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,135
Well, you figured me out.

797
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:45,100
Now just...

798
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:46,436
why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

799
00:50:46,438 --> 00:50:48,537
Everybody just calm down
for a second.

800
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:50,642
And what about that
record deal, Grandpa?

801
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,646
Record deal you pissed away?

802
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,314
The record deal I don't need
any of you for?

803
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:57,816
Okay, you know what?

804
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,686
You fucking two
deserve each other.

805
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:03,555
I'm out of here.

806
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:06,291
Poor baby.

807
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:14,833
What about you, Jimmy?

808
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,178
You want a taste?

809
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:33,351
Does this look tempting at all?

810
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:42,128
Come on.

811
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,363
No thanks, I'm allergic.

818
00:52:27,805 --> 00:52:28,706
You know...

819

She won't call me back and...

838
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,435
I guess it's over.

839
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:35,671

relationship or the band?

840
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:37,442
Fuck you, dude, okay, shut up.

843
00:53:40,912 --> 00:53:42,278

I don't know, I mean...

849
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,994
It's undeniable,
she's one of a kind, dude.

850
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:57,296
She's...

851

She has something
really special that

01:01:49,867 --> 01:01:51,934
<i>♪ Mm, fade away ♪</i>

975
01:01:51,936 --> 01:01:53,710
<i>Right after that,</i>

976
01:01:54,305 --> 01:01:55,140
<i>Rick's girlfriend made him
listen to the demo.</i>

977
01:01:56,206 --> 01:01:58,109
<i>And we got that
record deal after all.</i>

978
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:00,441
<i>We were signed,
but we had to get Rick</i>

979
01:02:00,443 --> 01:02:01,813
<i>to support the record.</i>

980
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,849
<i>I knew what he wanted for that.</i>

981
01:02:04,247 --> 01:02:06,948
<i>So I threw a party
to set the mood.</i>

982
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,486
Hi, guys, it's your girl Kami,

983
01:02:08,718 --> 01:02:11,820
and you are hashtag blessed
for pressing play

984
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:14,957
because we are here
at the Hollow Body

985
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:19,794
record release party
with bad boy Jimmy Kleen.

986
01:02:19,796 --> 01:02:21,296
Jimmy, thanks for joining us.

987
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:22,398
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

988
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,834
Yes, and you're back!

989
01:02:24,836 --> 01:02:26,167
- Yeah.
- Okay.

990
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:27,403
Back from the dead.

991
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:28,903
Clean living.

992
01:02:28,905 --> 01:02:30,508
Stay in school, don't do drugs.

993
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:34,845
Oh, and there's the lead singer,
Rachel.

994
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,314
Who's that she's with?

995
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:38,379
- Who knows?
- Whoa!

996
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,351
- She's a wild child.
- Huh.

997
01:02:41,218 --> 01:02:43,487
Just give me a second,
all right?

998
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:46,157
Uh, pardon me.

999
01:02:47,925 --> 01:02:50,425
Sorry, bud, can you just
back off, all right bud?

1000
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:51,894
She's grinding on me, asshole.

1001
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:53,461
All right, calm down,
calm down.

1002
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:56,265
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Okay, no worries.

1003
01:02:56,267 --> 01:02:57,535
Dude, turn that off.

1004
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,968
- Come on.
- Dude, he hit me!

1005
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,937
Hey, hey,
what the fuck, Jimmy?

1006
01:03:01,939 --> 01:03:03,405
Rick's going to be here
any minute.

1007
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:05,506
Can you stay sober
for five fucking minutes?

1008
01:03:05,508 --> 01:03:07,344
You had your fun,
I'm having mine.

1009
01:03:07,778 --> 01:03:09,879
Listen, you said
you wanted a record deal.

1010
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:11,512
Well, here it is,
so don't fucking blow it.

1011
01:03:11,514 --> 01:03:13,381
I said I wanted
to be in a band.

1012
01:03:13,383 --> 01:03:14,552
Well, you are in a band.

1013
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:16,318
Now it's time to hit
the high notes.

1014
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,122
We're not even
performing tonight.

1015
01:03:19,322 --> 01:03:21,559
Well, Rick's not sure
about distribution, all right?

1016
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:23,392
So if you can just put on

1017
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:24,930
a little private performance
for him.

1018
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:26,231
Convince him.

1019
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,974
Let's not mince words.

1020
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:40,244
I fuck him,
he pushes the record?

1021
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:44,416
Rock and roll.

1022
01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:46,283
Rock and roll.

1023
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:51,889
Hey. Hey, what the hell
was that? You all right?

1024
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:54,920
I'm fine.

1025
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,526
What's gotten into you?

1026
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:01,932
Isn't this what you wanted?

1027
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:04,535
I wanted you to be
a better performer.

1028
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:07,271
I like the old you.

1029
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you okay?

1030
01:04:19,582 --> 01:04:22,151
Okay, all right,
come on, outside somewhere.

1031
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:24,289
...parking, get her outside,
sort her out.

1032
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:26,291
All right.

1033
01:04:26,557 --> 01:04:28,392
Wait for him there.
Don't say anything stupid.

1034
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:33,963
Oh, hi, you're, um,

1035
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:35,597
- you're Rick Rollins and I'm...
- Yeah.

1036
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,669
I'm a such
a fan of your label.

1037
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:40,680
I play drums in Hollow Body.

1038
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,171
- Rick. Hey.
- This is Jimmy.

1039
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:42,570
- Thank you for coming, bro.
- Good to see you.

1040
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:44,174
- You met Zach, the drummer.
- I did.

1041
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:45,375
You okay?

1042
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:49,346
No.

1043
01:04:53,117 --> 01:04:54,185
You're bad.

1044
01:04:54,452 --> 01:04:56,921
You are.

1045
01:04:58,421 --> 01:04:59,590
Please.

1046
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:03,227
I'm not dead.

1047
01:05:04,595 --> 01:05:05,664
Aren't you?

1048
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,100
Rachel, this is Rick.

1049
01:05:10,434 --> 01:05:13,604
Hey, I'd shake hands,
but I'll give you this instead.

1050
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,209
Save me from this scene.

1051
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:19,644
All right.

1052
01:05:28,485 --> 01:05:29,720
Where are they going?

1053
01:05:30,588 --> 01:05:33,191
Don't worry about it,
all right? Settle down.

1054
01:06:09,959 --> 01:06:11,292
<i>I got to be honest with you.</i>

1055
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:13,195
I know you're
an artist and everything,

1056
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:15,265
but you're so fucking hot.

1057
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:18,100
The only thing on my mind is,

1058
01:06:18,102 --> 01:06:19,637
excuse me, fucking.

1059
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:21,669
You know,
I got a place down in Cabo,

1060
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,372
we should go down there.

1061
01:06:23,374 --> 01:06:24,640
We could do some songwriting,

1062
01:06:24,642 --> 01:06:26,575
we can get to know
each other better.

1063
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:28,744
I got a plane out at
the Santa Monica airport,

1064
01:06:28,746 --> 01:06:30,548
we can get down there
in about two hours.

1065
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:33,414
All right, Rick.

1066
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:36,500
And just in case you
don't make me come,

1067
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,287
let's talk business.

1068
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:38,555
I'm sorry?

1069
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:41,626
I want to open
for your biggest act.

1070
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:44,593
I want a publishing deal,

1071
01:06:44,595 --> 01:06:46,727
I keep 50 percent
of whatever the band makes,

1072
01:06:46,729 --> 01:06:48,733
and I want a million
in marketing.

1073
01:06:50,401 --> 01:06:51,302
To start.

1074
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,637
Wow.

1075
01:06:55,338 --> 01:06:57,439
May I ask you
a personal question?

1076
01:06:57,441 --> 01:06:58,640
Anything.

1077
01:06:58,642 --> 01:06:59,778
How old are you?

1078
01:07:00,211 --> 01:07:02,714
Because you seem
very mature for your age.

1079
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:05,116
I'm older than I look.

1080
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:07,718
Well, you got fabulous genes.

1081
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:10,187
I get them from
my mother's side.

1082
01:07:13,124 --> 01:07:15,293
Why don't we move somewhere
a little bit more...

1083
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:18,950
private?

1084
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:19,596
I'd love to.

1085
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:47,758
Zach,
he loves playing the drums.

1086
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,392
- Where are you going?
- Just move.

1087
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:52,597
Whoa, whoa, or what?

1088
01:07:53,164 --> 01:07:54,695
What are you gonna
head-butt me too?

1089
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:57,298
I might just throw
you in the fucking pool.

1090
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,836
- Stop it.
- Oh, you're drunk.

1091
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,568
All right, we'll get you home.

1092
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,336
Yeah, where's home, huh?

1093
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:04,205
What, the house
that Carrie kicked me out of

1094
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:05,740
or the apartment I can't afford?

1095
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:07,209
What's your fucking
wife's problem?

1096
01:08:07,211 --> 01:08:08,376
You didn't even touch her.

1097
01:08:08,378 --> 01:08:10,312
The problem is I wanted to.

1098
01:08:10,314 --> 01:08:12,650
But you decided not to
do anything, all right?

1099
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,349
And that was a choice.

1100
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,320
Yeah.

1101
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:16,688
So deal with it.

1102
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,522
Is that her choice?

1103
01:08:18,856 --> 01:08:20,525
No one's holding
a gun to her head.

1104
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:24,795
Hang on a second.

1105
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:28,666
Something's not right.

1106
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,902
You just need to relax.

1107
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:32,169
Yeah?

1108
01:08:32,469 --> 01:08:33,438
Let it happen.

1109
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,452
It's done.

1110
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,461
Let's go have a cigarette.

1111
01:10:04,961 --> 01:10:06,496
I think I've earned it.

1112
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:25,917
I can see why she likes you.

1113
01:10:28,318 --> 01:10:29,190
Rachel?

1114
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,923
Rachel.

1115
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:41,965

1135
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,219
<i>You'd think that killing
the head of your label</i>

1136
01:13:49,452 --> 01:13:51,190
<i>would be a bad thing.</i>

1137
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,753
<i>Out of respect for the family,</i>

1138
01:13:52,755 --> 01:13:54,959
<i>I told Rick's dad
it was a heart attack.</i>

1139
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:56,925
<i>They've been
going around lately.</i>

1140
01:13:56,927 --> 01:13:58,360
<i>So next thing you know,</i>

1141
01:13:58,362 --> 01:14:00,631
<i>he's talking about
throwing a benefit concert,</i>

1142
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,668
<i>and guess who managed
to get on the line up?</i>

1143
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:17,581
<i>Please come.</i>

1144
01:14:18,749 --> 01:14:20,500
How can we afford it?

1145
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:21,919
You're not getting paid.

1146
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,923
Well, it's a benefit.
I mean, nobody's getting paid.

1147
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:29,994
An infant does not belong
at a rock concert.

1148
01:14:33,729 --> 01:14:34,863
We'll get, like,

1149
01:14:34,865 --> 01:14:36,701
little baby headphones
or something.

1150
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,868
Please, this is, like,

1151
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,806
the biggest show
I've ever played.

1152
01:14:43,874 --> 01:14:45,410
Good for you.

1153
01:14:46,643 --> 01:14:48,145
You got everything you wanted.

1154
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:51,682
No, not everything.

1155
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,180
I...

1156
01:14:57,653 --> 01:14:58,688
Oh, Carrie.

1157
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,291
- No, I...
- Come on, don't.

1158
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:02,559
Carrie.

1159
01:15:34,523 --> 01:15:36,893
Richie was a great friend,
a brother, really.

1160
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,162
Struck down in his prime.

1161
01:15:40,129 --> 01:15:42,931
Yeah, well,
that's why we're here, right?

1162
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:44,766
Make something good
come out of it.

1163
01:15:44,768 --> 01:15:48,305
Can we just, um,
talk about the heart attacks?

1164
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:51,873
'Cause every gig we do,
someone dies.

1165
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,740
What, are we cursed?

1166
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,813
This is a benefit
for heart disease.

1167
01:15:56,179 --> 01:15:57,715
Have a fucking heart.

1168
01:15:58,115 --> 01:15:59,317
We're just gonna sit here

1169
01:15:59,549 --> 01:16:00,914
and act like
nothing's happening?

1170
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,160
Just stick to the music,

1171
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,219
- please, man!
- Dude!

1172
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:05,252
People die all the time.

1173
01:16:05,254 --> 01:16:07,657
Okay, well, let's just keep
doing the interview.

1174
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:10,994
Talk about the first night,
the party.

1175
01:16:13,562 --> 01:16:16,366
Well, technically,
we crashed that party.

1176
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:19,102
Technically? Definitely.

1177
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:23,400
Thank God you did.

1178
01:16:26,576 --> 01:16:28,243
I got something for you.

1179
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:29,276
Yeah?

1180
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:30,180
Earned it.

1181
01:16:33,316 --> 01:16:35,850
No, dude.

1182
01:16:35,852 --> 01:16:36,754
Yeah.

1183
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,656
- You serious?
- Serious.

1184
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:25,436
Hi, babies.

1185
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:26,370
Wow.

1186
01:17:28,205 --> 01:17:29,173
You like?

1187
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:35,243
You know it's raining out there.
You're gonna be freezing.

1188
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:36,914
Don't worry about me, baby.

1189
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:39,182
I'll outlive all of you.

1190
01:17:43,754 --> 01:17:45,156
What are we drinking to?

1191
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,794
Hmm, me.

1192
01:17:55,197 --> 01:17:57,133
How you feeling?

1193
01:18:04,406 --> 01:18:05,308
Never better.

1194
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:13,217
You'll never guess who's here.

1195
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,322
Surprise.

1196
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:20,790
Carrie?

1197
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,834
- You're...
- Hey.

1198
01:18:38,842 --> 01:18:39,744
You look great.

1199
01:18:42,112 --> 01:18:43,781
- How's she doing?
- Great.

1200
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,420
- Nice headphones.
- I thought you'd like them.

1201
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:53,491
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't me, it was...

1202
01:18:53,723 --> 01:18:54,992
it was Rachel.

1203
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:58,229
She arranged for us to come
and wanted to surprise you.

1204
01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:03,334
- Thanks.
- Are you all right?

1205
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,972
Yeah, no, I'm much better now.

1206
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:10,273
Hollow Body, you're next.

1207
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,276
About time.

1208
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:16,410
Come, let's go freshen up
in my dressing room real quick.

1209
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:17,881
Rachel, we don't
have time for that.

1210
01:19:18,814 --> 01:19:20,817
Relax, can't start without me.

1211
01:19:30,293 --> 01:19:33,197
We did it, man,
just like I promised you.

1212
01:19:33,863 --> 01:19:35,363
Yeah.

1213
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:37,367
Come on, man,
I thought you'd be happier.

1214
01:19:38,802 --> 01:19:41,505
You've dreamt about this
since the moment I met you.

1215
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:46,100
Yeah,
but just not like this, man.

1216
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:52,312
Yeah, well, it's never
the way you want it to be.

1217
01:19:52,314 --> 01:19:54,148
Dude, you're just...
you're not hearing me though.

1218
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,187
- It's...
- You're right, I'm not.

1219
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,222
Jimmy...

1220
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:03,893
Wow. This is, uh...

1221
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:06,964
this is pretty amazing.

1222
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:12,837
Don't think I've ever...

1223
01:20:13,536 --> 01:20:16,207
been in a room
with this many mirrors before.

1224
01:20:22,278 --> 01:20:23,580
Yeah, it's kind of, um...

1225
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:27,250
a pre-show ritual.

1226
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,489
You get what you need?

1227
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:38,161
Oh, yeah.

1228
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,300
All right, boys.

1229
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:49,405
Where's Carrie?

1230
01:20:50,506 --> 01:20:52,175
She'll be down in a minute.

1231
01:20:54,611 --> 01:20:56,947
Don't worry, she's got
the best seat in the house.

1232
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:05,956
Could you take a picture
of me before the show?

1233
01:21:06,455 --> 01:21:07,357
Yeah.

1234
01:21:18,268 --> 01:21:19,904
I fucking knew it.

1235
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:22,906
Oops.

1236
01:21:24,273 --> 01:21:26,110
Yeah, about that...

1237
01:21:27,544 --> 01:21:30,314
You know, Carrie,
you're very sweet.

1238
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:34,951
But Scott doesn't want sweet.

1239
01:21:36,553 --> 01:21:37,655
He wants me.

1240
01:21:39,656 --> 01:21:41,292
They're waiting for us, Rachel.

1241
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,994
Yeah, but you're not Rachel,
are you?

1242
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:47,640
Not since the accident.

1243
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:51,201
Those heart attacks,
that you, too?

1244
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:00,311
Who do you think you are?

1245
01:22:03,646 --> 01:22:04,682
Look at me.

1246
01:22:08,284 --> 01:22:09,687
You don't know what Scott wants.

1247
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,722
You think I'm sweet?

1248
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,692
There's more to me.

1249
01:22:15,224 --> 01:22:16,160
Yeah?

1250
01:22:16,393 --> 01:22:17,461
You don't know me.

1251
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:21,640
You don't know my family.
You don't know Scott.

1252
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,367
What do you...

1253
01:22:25,268 --> 01:22:26,170
You fucking...

1254
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:46,690
Mm.

1255
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:54,497
Oh!

1256
01:22:55,665 --> 01:22:56,700
Oh.

1257
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:03,639
You're bad.

1258
01:23:05,642 --> 01:23:07,770
It's show time.

1259
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,620
<i>People, it's time, you're on!</i>

1260
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,597
Jimmy, dude, what the hell
are we gonna do?

1261
01:23:27,296 --> 01:23:28,462
We play.

1262
01:23:28,464 --> 01:23:29,365
With that?

1263
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:35,470
Oh, I've played with worse.
Dude, we're gonna...

1264
01:23:35,472 --> 01:23:38,710
- Jimmy.
- Come on. Let's go!

1265
01:23:44,214 --> 01:23:45,482
This is unbelievable.

1266
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:47,550
Zach, dude...

1267
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:10,107
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Hollywood, California,</i>

1268
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:13,143
<i>Hollow Body.</i>

1269
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:27,390
<i>The strike killed us instantly.</i>

1270
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,427
<i>The fire took another
nine people.</i>

1271
01:24:30,759 --> 01:24:33,597
<i>Injured? I don't know, 50.</i>

1272
01:24:37,534 --> 01:24:38,669
<i>But you know what?</i>

1273
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,437
<i>They never found Rachel.</i>

1274
01:24:42,104 --> 01:24:43,107
<i>Not a trace.</i>

1275
01:24:43,473 --> 01:24:44,374
<i>Vanished.</i>

1276
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,245
<i>Always leave them wanting more.</i>

1277
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:14,403
<i>They say death
is the ultimate career move.</i>

1278
01:25:16,305 --> 01:25:17,307
<i>I should know.</i>

01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,211
